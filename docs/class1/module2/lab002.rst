Lab – Excuting the PUA Script
------------------------------------------------
**Overview**

The ./build_pua.sh script will do a pre-flight check to ensure all the pre-requisites are met and will invoke a UCS backup by default before making any changes. If this script is run on a BIG-IP with a trial license, you must use the -s or --sanity option to prevent checking for licensing restrictions, this should only be done in a non-production environment as this may cause issues with production systems.  

After each invocation, a log file will be left in /var/log called f5-pua-install-xxxx.log which will outline all the actions taken along with the result or any errors encountered. This log file may be requested by support or an F5 engineer to assist in any troubleshooting. 

**Usage** 

Invoking ./build_pua.sh with "-h" or "--help" will alert you to the potential options you may use to modify the behavior of the script. As of this document and version 1.1.3 the current options are:


.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 40
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Options**
      - **Descriptions**    
    * - -h, -\\-help
      - This Notice
    * - -s -\\-sanity
      - Bypass santiy checks (license, BIG-IP status)
    * - -u -\\-update
      - Update existing installation
    * - -e -\\-extract
      - Extract files to temp location and exit 
    * - -n -\\-nobackup
      - Does not perform UCS backup
    * - -c -\\-checkonly
      - Check installed versions against this package
    * - -d -\\-disabletest
      - Disable test user
    * - -f -\\-forceupgrade
      - Force upgrade of packages from this archive

Task – Running Installation Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


#. Login to into the BIG-IP via SSH

#. Change Directory to **/var/tmp/pua**

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd /var/tmp/pua

   |image01|

#. Verify the **pua_config.sh** 

   .. code-block:: bash

      cat pua_config.sh

   |image02|

#. Run the PUA installation script **./build_pua.sh**

   .. code-block:: bash
     
      ./build_pua.sh
 
   |image03|

   .. note:: The build script reports all changes to log in **/var/log/f5-pua-install-**
